## Design

The visual aspects of the website were carefully chosen to convey the atmosphere of an old library with it's bookish vibe while at the same time remaining modern and minimalistic.

### Font
I used fonts from GoogleFonts. I have chosen Montserrat for it's clean, elegant look and Special Elite for the resemblance to traditional typewriter print to stand out on the background of old yellowed paper.

### Colour

The colour scheme is simple, consisting 3 earthy tones complementing hero image.

### Accesibility

I received the following scores on my lighthouse testing

![Lighthouse](docs/readme/lighthouse.webp)


### Features Left to Implement

- I wanted to add a searchbar on the right side of the navbar.

- Displaying quotes in assigned categories.

- My Favourite Quotes page for every user. 

- Utilizing better admin's option to verify quotes. Possibly display quote with a note that it is not verified yet. 



## Testing 


### BUGS

 - I encountered several bugs while creating this project.

- Bootstrap navbar went through many stages of not working on smaller devices. From being permanently closed to being permanently open. I run out of time to sort the problem and currently on the mobile phone screens hamburger icon sits beside the permanently open navigation menu.

- I also had an issue with Bootstrap Logo inside the navbar not being responsive and covering most of the navbar on smaller screens. I have tested many solutions but finally solved it by adding "style=max-width:30vw" directly to the logo.

- I had several issues with static being disconnected after collectstatic command. It turned out to be a combination of website loading from cache and incorrect url pattern.

- Early on I had issues with virtual environment but managed to solve them with the help of the youtube tutorial - details in credits.



### User Testing

The application was tested on HP Pavilion using Firefox and Google Chrome browser.

I also tested it on the following mobile devices:
  Galaxy S21 Ultra
  Oppo Reno 2
All worked as planned with the exception of the Bootstrap navbar - as described in detail in Bugs section.
 
I also utilised Google Chrome Dev tools to test it on an Ipad and it was working correctly.


### Validator Testing 

- Python passed through Code Institute Linter without issues:


![Python1](docs/readme/python1.webp)
![Python2](docs/readme/python2.webp)
![Python3](docs/readme/python3.webp)
![Python4](docs/readme/python4.webp)
![Python5](docs/readme/python5.webp)
![Python6](docs/readme/python6.webp)

- CSS validated with  Jigsaw CSS Validator:

![CSS1](docs/readme/css1.webp)
![CSS2](docs/readme/css2.webp)  

- HTML validated with Rocketvalidator - it was more convenient to use than the W3C one due to the inclusions of Java Script among HTML.
It returned 4 errors and 4 warnings. All warnings were related to "possible misuse of aria-label in the context of paper texture background.
All 4 errors were caused by the code on Allauth pages.

### Manual Testing

- ensured the app loads on all browsers
- ensured the elements (such as buttons, forms, and menu) are visible
- tested the clickable elements on the app page
- ensured the page content is visible on all devices

Manually tested across several devices:
- the links
- the buttons
- signup, sign in, login and functionality
- CRUD functionality
- verify fields and their inputs

Tests were concluded with positive results other than a toggle malfunction on small screen devices mentioned earlier.

- Negative test was performed in a scenario where unregistered user was attempting to by pass login by typing url directly into the browser.
User was diverted to sign in page as expected.



### Unfixed Bugs
 - Toggle is not working correctly on mobile phone screens.


## Deployment

I created a separate file to outline the deployment process as it was too long to detail all of the steps here

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
  - Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed.. 

- Clone the Repository Code Locally
  - Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to clone to use locally:

  - Click on the code drop down button
  - Click on HTTPS
  - Copy the repository link to the clipboard
  - Open your IDE of choice (git must be installed for the next steps)
  - Type git clone copied-git-url into the IDE terminal
  - The project will now of been cloned on your local machine for use.

- Fork the repository
  - For creating a copy of the repository on your account and change it without affecting the original project, useFork directly from GitHub:

  - On My Repository Page, press Fork in the top right of the page
  - A forked version of my project will appear in your repository

- Heroku 
  - The project was deployed to Heroku following instructions from Code Institute Django Walkthrough tutorial.
